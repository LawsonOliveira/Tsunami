	abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks, the use of Feynman-Kac formula and one using a deep backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) solver are the three methods explained. Since the PDE we will dervive from the Mild-Slope equation, it will not necessarily be linear or even semilinear. So, the two last methods can be set apart to only focus on the PINN method. The PINN method is general to any PDE ; it suffices to inform of the equation and differentiate the functions involved. The article comes with the code.}

	abstract = {This article dwells on a method to solve a PDE on complex geometries without assisting the neural network to satisfy the boundary conditions. Furthermore, training this neural networks only on the boundary of the domain can result in the neural networks already approximating well the solution of the PDE even inside the domain. It could accelerate the training of the neural networks considering the boundary consists in far less points than the full domain. Yet, the respect of the boundary conditions is not very satistfying.}
