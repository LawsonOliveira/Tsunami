Try to overfit 
=> if impossible : bug in the model or method
=> else : try to accelerate this overfitting ? or next step

Try to get validation <=10^{6}
- right now with the model and the loop made, it seems impossible. The system stops around a validation of 0.25. 
=> See the difference with jax NN
=> Solve issue with bias at the output layer of the model
