Based on the 1997 article ["Artificial Neural Networks for Solving Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/712178 "Article Link") by D.I. Fotiadis, I.E. Lagaris and A. Likas.

First attempts to use in practice the above paper, and benchmark the different polynomials we derived.
As we do not use this method to solve PDE, we decided to put it in a deprecated folder.
