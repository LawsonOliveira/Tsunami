# Introducing the topic

Tsunamis do not occur very often but are devastating phenomena. Researches and studies about tsunamis try to pave the way for saving societies and environment by predicting the extent of the phenomenon.
Laboratory and analytical models are not relevant. Although a numerical resolution could symplify problem's equations, it requires a huge computing power and a significant computing time without taking into account the accuracy errors due to turbulence.

The question that arise is how could we speed up fluid mechanics simulations ?
